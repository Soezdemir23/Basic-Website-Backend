            <p>This website is being presented through the backend.<br>Which means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I created a webserver, via NodeJs</li>
                <li>I didn't use a framework</li>
                <li>I got a look at how routing works behind the scenes</li>
                <li>I got a look at how files are actually read and served</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>That's cool, is this going to be some part of a portfolio?</h2>
            <p>Yes and no. I am actually starting to enjoy this. I like building new stuff and tinker with it.<br>
                A slow road set in stone, so it can weather the time.
                <br>This also helps me to track my projects and progress</p>
