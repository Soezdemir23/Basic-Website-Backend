# Basic webserver with basic website features

## What is this repository about?
I am building a website using node.js without any framework.

I will learn:
+ How the underlying low-level code works in setting up a basic webserver
+ How I can provide webservers with the files needed to present a working website
+ how routing works and is interpreted

## Where can I see this in action?
After this is done, you will see the webserver in repl.it with a link provided here.
